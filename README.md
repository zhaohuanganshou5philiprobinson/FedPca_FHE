# FedPca_FHE

**FedPca_FHE** is a privacy-preserving federated principal component analysis (PCA) framework powered by fully homomorphic encryption (FHE). It allows multiple data holders to collaboratively perform PCA on their datasets without exposing any raw data, enabling secure dimensionality reduction and data preprocessing.

## Project Overview

Collaborative machine learning often faces the following challenges:

* **Data Privacy:** Sensitive datasets cannot be shared directly between parties.
* **Regulatory Compliance:** Health, financial, or personal data may have strict legal restrictions.
* **Centralized Risks:** Aggregating raw data in a central server can lead to breaches or misuse.
* **Limited Cross-Organization Learning:** Traditional PCA requires centralized data access, preventing secure collaboration.

**FedPca_FHE** addresses these challenges using **FHE**, which allows computations directly on encrypted data. Parties can jointly compute PCA results without ever revealing their individual datasets.

### Federated Collaboration

* Multi-party PCA without a trusted aggregator
* Parties contribute encrypted data vectors and receive combined results
* Cross-organization dimensionality reduction while maintaining data sovereignty

### Security & Compliance

* Fully Homomorphic Encryption guarantees confidentiality throughout the computation
* Secure key management ensures that only authorized parties can decrypt final PCA results
* Compliant with data privacy regulations by design

### Analytical Insights

## How FHE is Applied

FHE is central to **FedPca_FHE**â€™s operation:

1. **Local Data Encryption:** Each party encrypts its dataset using FHE keys.
2. **Encrypted Aggregation:** The system computes covariance matrices and eigenvectors directly on encrypted data.
3. **Secure PCA Computation:** Principal components are derived without exposing raw data.
4. **Result Decryption:** Only authorized parties can decrypt and use the final PCA components.

**Advantages:**

* Zero exposure of raw data between collaborators
* Enables cloud-based computation without risking privacy
* Preserves data ownership while enabling collaborative insights
* Suitable for sensitive domains like healthcare, finance, and research

## Architecture

### Client-Side Components

* **Data Encryption Module:** Encrypts local datasets with FHE before transmission
* **Secure Key Storage:** Manages local FHE keys safely
* **Local Preprocessing:** Optional data normalization before encryption

### Federated Computation Engine

* **Encrypted Covariance Computation:** Computes covariance matrices across encrypted datasets
* **Secure Eigenvector Calculation:** Derives principal components from encrypted matrices
* **Aggregation & Synchronization:** Coordinates multi-party computation without decrypting data

### Data Flow

1. Each participant encrypts and submits data locally.
2. Encrypted data is sent to the federated computation engine.
3. FHE operations compute PCA results on encrypted matrices.
4. Encrypted results are sent back for authorized decryption.
